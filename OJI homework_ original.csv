It got pressured so hard that the first knuckle of my middle finger appeared to be smashed. I was kind of in shock but trying to finish my duties. By the time when I got off from the plane, my knuckle was not flat any more. Instead, a blood blister showed. It hurt pretty bad. It was my second trip after IOE, first time on ERJ. We had major delays that day. With all the anxiety of learning new things and the exhaustion of a long day, a wounded finger in the end didn't help at all. I was exhausted when we got to the hotel after midnight. I submitted an IOR for the inoperative HHD next day within 24 hrs. I thought about submitting an OJI but not sure if it's a big deal enough to do it. My knuckle looked better next day. The blood blister turned to a rather normal blister.

I relayed this information to MX control and the next captain taking the aircraft in Los Angeles.  Because of the pain of the bite, they decided a write up was in order.  I did notice the aircraft depart later, but am unsure if they found it or not.  I decided to continue my day as I didn't see any major red marks or alergic reactions.

Please Note: 
I didn't put this together until recently but I am fairly sure this wrist problem started while at training in SLC. I was having trouble identifying a trauma injury to my wrist and could not explain it. Then I remembered the new self-defense moves we learned that were focused on wrist pressure oriented moves. I have a strong feeling that the injury happened during that training event.

My classroom training day was October 4th. I started having wrist pain immediately after training. I wasn't scheduled to work until Oct 9th. I ended up calling off sick the 9th, 10th, 11th, & 12th. After that I had 2 weeks off for vacation. I was doing pretty good over the vacation timeframe because I was given a course of steroid treatment to bring down the swelling and inflammation. Once that wore off I ended up with the same problem. I managed to work some after my vacation with pain and a splint on my arm but in hindsight it probably wasn't the best thing to do.

Specifically I was cleaning and wiping down the seats and immediate area for possible spread of fecal matter that was though to have been transmitted due to the amount that was spread inside the lavatory. This was cleaned on 5B/C with the approved company spray cleaner. The reason for this report is during the disconnecting of the lav dump hose a small amount of fluid fell onto my shoe and likely splashed on my leg due to my wearing of shorts. Also, I was wearing a short sleeve shirt and it is likely that the skin on my arm touched the seat while bracing myself to stand up.
